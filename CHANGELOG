v2.8.3
- Highlighting applied to active modifiers
- reorganised the actor data structure (no effect on existing actors)

v2.8.2
- Exxar upgraded the roll-library to include modifiers for damage rolls

v2.8.1
- Gave FP and HP a plus-minus to make changes to current value
- created a system variable to permit 1/2 point increments for FP

v2.8
- This release does not appear to break existing actors
- added modifiers to the sheet which will modify any roll except damage when 
checked. You do have to enter all the details as they are fully configurable.
- added another three skill slots by restyling them. Becoming cramped.

v2.7
- This release should not break current actors but will give problems for some 
of the new item types as they have been reorganised and refined.
- realised after a play session that the undetected bug from v2.6, wasn't a bug
- Added a dev-readme for people who want to contribute.
- Added Items for Modifiers and Defences. (Conditions may not be necessary in 
addition to modifiers)
- Exxar's Size-Speed-Range ruler is integrated into the project and need not 
be imported as a module
- Exxar's Roll-Library is integrated into the project and need not be imported
as a module.
    - only Gmod and Dmod are currently supported but others will be soon
- The rollable items are usable from the items tab but others have no effect at this time.

v2.6.2
- Styled the items so they don't annoy me to look at them
- removed the + Add Item until I figure out how to make it choose from the 
different types rather than the legacy one. Not urgent because drag and drop 
works fine.

v2.6.1
- fixes to Items:
    - changed effectiveSkill to level
    - changed cost to String and removed currency
    - removed defaulting and consolidated the Skill, Spell, Technique and RM Spell
    into Rollable with a category for filtering
    - added Armour Divisor for weapons
    - show Armour Divisor and Damage Type in the item list on an actor sheet

v2.6
- fixed an undetected bug that would add G-Mod to damage rolls
- implemented a new set of rudimentary Items
    - Equipment
    - Hit Location
    - Melee attack
    - Ranged attack
    - Skill
    - Technique
    - Spell
    - Ritual Magic Spell
    - Trait
- kept the legacy Item for backwards compatibility (deprecated)
- there is a long way to go to make these more functional and prettier

v2.5
- borrowed heavily from WFRP to enable:
    - internationalisation
    - custom status effects
    - preparing actors on creation
    - configuration information storage
    - foundation for future migration capability
    - more I may be forgetting

v2.4.2
- fixed broken attack name inputs
- fixed layout issues (probably over-styled :-) Used a style hammer.

v2.4.1
- reverted the name change mess
- edited the presentation to reflect "any" GURPS edition.

v2.4.0
- WARNING: This version introduces some optional system settings and flags set in an actor 
at creation. If you wish to continue with the existing damage dice behaviour, you should 
have no problems with your existing actors. If you wish to use the new TextBox option you 
will have to duplicate your existing actors to set the flag for that in them. I have not yet
figured out how migration works; apologies.
- input text boxes now stretch to fill the available space.
- there are now three options for initiative determination in System Settings.
    - Game Settings > Configure Settings > System Settings
- you may use a System Setting to choose to enter damage dice using a TextBox or continue 
with the current method.

v2.3.1
- removed the useless reference to type fullchar so you don't have to pick an actor type

v2.3.0
- introduced a non-functional fullchar option to work on (don't make any, they don't work)
- refactored many attributes into the base template so they could be reused by fullchar
    - this has prevented older character versions from simply adding the extra field slots below but doesn't break them.
- fixed the tab functionality and created 'Main' and 'Items'
- increased the number of "check" slots to 18 in two rows.
- increased the number of attack slots to eight.
- increased the number of skill slots to 15.
- notes remains at the bottom of the Main page, while Items move to their own tab.

v2.2.1
- fixed the initiative rolls broken because of changed field names

v2.2.0
- added three more skill slots for twelve.

v2.1.0
- added an automated HP and FP status indicator on the sheet next to each title.
    - changes made to those fields on the sheet or the token will update the status
    - HP status values are: [H], [R], [C], [-X], -2X], [-3X], [-4X], [DEAD]
    - FP status values are: [F], [T], [C], [UNC]

v2.0.0
- gmod and dmod are both changed using plus-minus
- primary attributes are on the same row as defences and gmod and dmod
- there are nine configurable "check" slots - edit both name and value for a different success roll
- the six attacks are merged with their damage rolls
    - attacks operate like checks while damage uses plus-minus
- squeezed in a ninth skill slot without pushing the notes too far down the sheet
