===Jake's Requests===
A blank inventory character sheet at some point for chests and inventories would be really helpful though
Actually, nvm I think the Journal Dialogue with linked items might work better anyways
Out of something I would like is some way to request a skill or attribute roll from a macro which I think should be figured out when the fuck-off attack macro gets done.
Basically something where I can say "Roll [Lockpicking] with X Character Sheet" and so on.
Even being able to set up "GM Roll all players perception" would be great.

Request for traits, perhaps putting in something for levels in an advantage similar to how GCS does it?
