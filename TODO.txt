// TODO from session 5/27/2021
    - Brette Mode
    - Senses get all fucky
    - Custom base attribute
    - Spell shit, ie: scalable damage from chargeable missiles
    - Typeless damage (crushing except not crushing)
    - AD (Ignore armour)
    - Destructive Parry
    - Armour HP
    - Surge damage
    - Apply half and max range for ranged attacks
    - Double check skill based defaults (Metallurgy is at -5?)
    - Size mod for to-hit penalty with game parm for absolute or relative penalties (Ranged and melee separate. Jake does melee rleative, ranged absolute)
    - Shield does not appear in attack macro (Cap is 4 attack profiles for some reason? And old attacks sometimes disappear? None of Raven's attacks would show up at all)
    - Reset damage button
    - HP damage applied to token (And if linked it goes to actor?) IDK, all the squidwards were being treated as the same dude. Make that not happen
    - Input sanitization for rof missing, among other things (Players be dumb)
    - Spells as quick contest, Regular spell range, etc.
    - Low HP should impact dodge (Unless HPT?)
    - Rof bonus comes up NaN for some reason? But only sometimes? WTF?
    - Incidental damage (Rolling 9s vs people behind/front of main target)
    - Uncategorized at the bottom of the list

Naval
    - Naval character sheet

Design
    - Gun design system
    - Laser design system

===Jake's Requests===
A blank inventory character sheet at some point for chests and inventories would be really helpful though
Actually, nvm I think the Journal Dialogue with linked items might work better anyways
Out of something I would like is some way to request a skill or attribute roll from a macro which I think should be figured out when the fuck-off attack macro gets done.
Basically something where I can say "Roll [Lockpicking] with X Character Sheet" and so on.
Even being able to set up "GM Roll all players perception" would be great.
