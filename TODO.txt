===Jake's Requests===
A blank inventory character sheet at some point for chests and inventories would be really helpful though
Actually, nvm I think the Journal Dialogue with linked items might work better anyways
Out of something I would like is some way to request a skill or attribute roll from a macro which I think should be figured out when the fuck-off attack macro gets done.
Basically something where I can say "Roll [Lockpicking] with X Character Sheet" and so on.
Even being able to set up "GM Roll all players perception" would be great.
