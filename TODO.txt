Layered Armour
    - Ensure only equipped armour gets totalled
    - Make entering armour suck less (Remove default 0?)
    - Add the armour tab to traits
    - Slam thingy
    - Make giant fuck-off macro for to-hit
    - Make giant fuck-off macro for active defences
    - Make giant fuck-off macro for damage

Specific perception
    - Base 5 senses
    - Allow for extra senses (Magery, Detect, Scanning Sense, Enhanced Senses stuff, etc)

Campaign toggles for...
    - Rigid armour can take blunt trauma (Unofficial)
    - Edge protection (Optional)
    - Armour as Dice (Optional)
    - Bleeding (Optional)
    - Thigh Gap over Artery (Optional)

Misc
    - Add area of effect for attacks
    - Setting Adv/Disadv/perk/quirk on a trait seems to reset back to advantage
    - Separate Adv/Disadv so they display separately in the point subtotals
    - Change weight to specify pounds and require number so we can do gravity stuff later
    - Combat Reflexes flag for dodge, parry, block
    - Setting a specific damage for an attack errors out (6 does not work, but 0d6+6 does)

===Jake's Requests===
A blank inventory character sheet at some point for chests and inventories would be really helpful though
Actually, nvm I think the Journal Dialogue with linked items might work better anyways
Out of something I would like is some way to request a skill or attribute roll from a macro which I think should be figured out when the fuck-off attack macro gets done.
Basically something where I can say "Roll [Lockpicking] with X Character Sheet" and so on.
Even being able to set up "GM Roll all players perception" would be great.
